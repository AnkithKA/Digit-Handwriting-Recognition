# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition with CNN

This project demonstrates a real-time handwritten digit recognition system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Users can draw digits on a virtual canvas, and the trained model predicts the drawn digit with high accuracy.

## Features

- **Real-Time Prediction**: Draw digits directly on a canvas and get instant predictions.
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Utilizes a deep learning model trained on the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition.
- **Data Augmentation**: Incorporates random rotations, zooms, and translations to improve model generalization.
- **Interactive GUI**: Built using `Tkinter` to allow users to interact with the application easily.
